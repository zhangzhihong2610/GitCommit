## 🚀 Running the Project

This project is a refactor based on [light-assistant](https://github.com/HiMeditator/light-assistant), with an optimized project structure and frontend rebuilt using Vue 3.


### Install Dependencies

If your environment does not have `pnpm`, first run `npm install -g pnpm` to install it.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Run the Frontend

Running the frontend with this command will not connect it to VS Code, so interaction is not possible.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Build Frontend Content into the Plugin

After making changes to the frontend, you need to execute this command to update the content in the plugin.

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Run the Plugin

Use VS Code, find `Run > Start Debugging` to run the plugin. Windows users can use the shortcut key `F5` to run the plugin.

### Package the Plugin

Before packaging, ensure that any frontend changes have been updated to the plugin using `pnpm build`.

```bash
pnpm package
```
