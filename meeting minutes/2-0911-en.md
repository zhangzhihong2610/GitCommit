### General Confirmation of Final Project Goal and Presentation Form

 **Goal** : Develop a VS Code plugin for exception log parsing and localization.

* Log localization is based on [LogLLM](https://github.com/guanwei49/LogLLM/tree/master).
* A Q&A window will be displayed on the right side of VS Code, presented in the form of a conversational agent.

### Preliminary Analysis of Project Challenges

* Wenhao: Implementation details of  **privacy information masking** .
* Fu Yu: Failed to run LogLLM, reason currently unclear.
* LogLLM requires a  **CUDA environment** , and local deployment needs GPU support.

### Draft Email to TA Regarding Project Topic Suitability

* Email sent, awaiting reply.

### Work Plan for This Week

Suggested reference materials:

* VSCode Plugin Development Guide [GitHub](https://github.com/sxei/vscode-plugin-demo) / [Blog](https://blog.haoji.me/vscode-plugin-overview.html)

Each member should find a related project to study and reproduce, then share their work in the next meeting.

## Additional Reference Material

> ### 1. Suggested Team Division
>
> Based on project characteristics, work can be divided into relatively independent modules:
>
> * **Requirements & Architecture Design Group**
>   * Define core plugin functions (log parsing, Q&A window, code localization).
>   * Define non-functional requirements (performance, responsiveness, scalability).
>   * Draw architecture diagram (VS Code frontend + backend service + LogLLM API).
> * **LogLLM Integration Group (Backend)**
>   * Familiarize with LogLLM invocation.
>   * Encapsulate log parsing interface for VS Code plugin calls.
>   * Implement exception localization algorithm and Q&A agent logic.
> * **VS Code Plugin Development Group (Frontend)**
>   * Implement plugin UI (Q&A panel, log viewer).
>   * Develop communication interface with backend (REST API / WebSocket).
>   * Optimize user interaction (e.g., click on log → jump to code).
> * **Testing & Documentation Group**
>   * Write plugin user guide.
>   * Design test cases (various log exceptions).
>   * Record development process, maintain burndown chart and agile sprint logs.
>
> ---
>
> ### 2. Suggested Development Workflow
>
> * **Sprint 1 (Weeks 2–5)**
>   * Define user stories (developer workflow: input/output).
>   * Set up basic VS Code plugin framework + simple LogLLM integration.
>   * Implement basic log parsing functionality.
> * **Sprint 2 (Weeks 6–9)**
>   * Complete Q&A panel interaction logic.
>   * Add code localization feature.
>   * Improve code quality (linting, modularization, testability).
> * **Sprint 3 (Weeks 10–13)**
>   * Automated testing (integrate Jest/Mocha for plugin testing).
>   * Performance optimization (large-scale log processing).
>   * Finalize demo video, poster, and report.
>
> ---
>
> ### 3. Suggested Team Practices
>
> * **Weekly Meetings** : Fixed weekly stand-up for progress and issues.
> * **Coding Standards** : Unified ESLint/Prettier rules to avoid inconsistency.
> * **Task Management** : Use GitHub Projects/Trello for tasks and sprint goals.
> * **Contribution Records** : Each member documents responsibilities in GitHub commits, issues, and PRs for final report.
> * **Early Demo** : Deliver a minimal viable product (MVP) early to validate feasibility.
>
> ---
>
> ✅  **Overall Approach** :
>
> * **Early stage** : Quickly finalize functions and architecture, deliver MVP.
> * **Mid stage** : Enhance functionality, improve interaction, ensure code quality.
> * **Late stage** : Complete testing, documentation, and presentation materials.
